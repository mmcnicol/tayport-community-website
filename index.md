Tayport FC’s New Programme Archive

Tayport Football Club has been issuing programmes for most home matches since the early 1990s and every one of these programmes plus some issued in the club’s amateur days is now available on a new website [www.tayportfcarchive.com](http://www.tayportfcarchive.com/)

It’s a comprehensive Archive of 435 programmes which have been digitised by staff at the University of St Andrews Library.

Through the medium of these matchday programmes the Archive traces the fortunes of Tayport FC during its hugely successful period in Junior Football from 1990 to the present day, playing matches against almost 100 different clubs.
It’s a period in which the club made six Scottish Junior Cup Final appearances, winning three, won two East Region Super League titles, two Premier League titles, nine Tayside Championships and thirty two local and regional cup competitions. 

It’s a veritable cornucopia of Junior football nostalgia with a good measure of community interest thrown in.

Tayport FC would be pleased to receive any comments or answer any questions relating to the Archive.

[What Next For Cubs And Brownies?](<a href="pdfs/2017-08-29-cubs-brownies.pdf)

The Leaders of our respective Brownies and Cub Scouts have long recognised that we have been over reliant on our neighbouring Guides and Scout troops to support the young people of Tayport in the 10-14 year age group.

It is planned to hold a meeting on Monday 25th September in the Scout Hall at 7.30pm to explore forming a Scout troop in Tayport.  We would welcome parents or anyone with a interest in this community initiative to attend.

Why a scout troop?  The Scouts are the only uniform group that welcomes both girls and boys and allows us to pool resources to provide an outlet for our young people.  It will allow those moving on from the Brownies and Cubs to the next stage of their adventure.

Please join us on Monday 25th September or if you can't join us we would welcome your input either by email or on our respective Facebook pages.
