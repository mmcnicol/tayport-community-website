Tayport Scout Troop:<br>We are now in a position to look at the refurbishment of the exterior of the Scout Hall. This will allow us to improve the facilities we provide as well as allowing us to develop new services. It is important that the community has a say in how we take this forward and we would be grateful if you would take a few minutes to complete the attached survey. This should take no longer than 2 minutes to complete. [https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/8WBJZWY](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/8WBJZWY)

[What Next For Cubs And Brownies?](<a href="pdfs/2017-08-29-cubs-brownies.pdf)

The Leaders of our respective Brownies and Cub Scouts have long recognised that we have been over reliant on our neighbouring Guides and Scout troops to support the young people of Tayport in the 10-14 year age group.

It is planned to hold a meeting on Monday 25th September in the Scout Hall at 7.30pm to explore forming a Scout troop in Tayport.  We would welcome parents or anyone with a interest in this community initiative to attend.

Why a scout troop?  The Scouts are the only uniform group that welcomes both girls and boys and allows us to pool resources to provide an outlet for our young people.  It will allow those moving on from the Brownies and Cubs to the next stage of their adventure.

Please join us on Monday 25th September or if you can't join us we would welcome your input either by email or on our respective Facebook pages.

<a href="media/2017-burgh-gregory.jpg">Community Assets Transfer</a>

<strong>Derek Gray‎ to Tayport Community Council</strong>

I am pleased to report that 20 local residents (including some representing local groups/organisations) plus our three Councillors and officers from Fife Council, attended the meeting to discuss interest in setting up a working group to explore the future of the Burgh Chambers and Gregory Hall.

Lots of very relevant questions were asked and the outcome was that ten people have signed up to be part of the working group which will have its first meeting on either Tuesday 19th or Tuesday 26th September 2017 (date to be confirmed), 7.00pm at the Burgh Chambers. If anyone else would wish to join the working group, please contact me so I can advise which date is finally agreed – dek.gray@gmail.com, tel 07539 932018

I expect an early priority of the working group will be to identify how best to keep the community updated on the progress it is making.

Thank you to everyone for their interest and contributions and to Janice Laird, Fife Council’s Community Manager for North East Fife Area for her input.

Derek Gray
